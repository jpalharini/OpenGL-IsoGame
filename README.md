# Isometric game using OpenGL

This is one of my projects completed as part of the Graphical Processing subject at UNISINOS. It consists of a little game using an isometric map.

The biggest challenge was projecting the mouse-click onto the map (applying the correction from a 2D matrix onto isometric tiles). That was hard!
